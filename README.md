# may-it-be [WIP]

may-it-be provides tools that help use a family of web component decorators starting wth be-.  Those decorators can extend the behavior of native, built-in components, as well as of other custom elements. 

It is also planned that this repo will be used to provide a unified documentation side for this HTML framework.
